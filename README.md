# Dash_Plotly_Radio_Ticket_Dashboard
This is a dashboard for 2G, 3G and 4G radio access network performance tickets. This dashboard helps radio network performance management engineers to see site locations, performance tickets as well as KPI statistics all in one place. Otherwise, they would have to use three different software. I prepared it using dash, plotly and dash-bootstrap libraries.
